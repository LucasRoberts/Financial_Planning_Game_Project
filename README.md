<h1 align="center">Retirement Reality</h1>

# About The Project
This project is the electronic version of A board game created by my group for our course project in Financial Management. Our goal in creating this game is to 
demonstrate two main ideas: **investing** and **saving for retirement**. Using [Money Magic](https://playmoneymagic.com/) as our inspiration for the game we
were able to come up with a multiplayer board game that focuses on those two topics.

The minimum viable product for this game is:
- A barebones menu and play screen GUI 
- Single player capibilities
- Game state that allows for at least the minimum playability
- How to play screen
