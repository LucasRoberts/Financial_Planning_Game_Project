How Each Turn Goes:

The round begins with each player flipping over an action card from the main deck
(the player with the lowest age card flips a card first and goes clockwise).
They then will all fill out their Income Allocation Board by following the
requirements on the action card. The players will then fill out the rest
of the Income Allocation Board with their remaining income, abiding by their
housing expenses, life expenses, savings fund, and retirement contributions.
